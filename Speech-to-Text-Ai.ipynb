Although Edison is often credited as the sole inventor of the electric bulb, there were many other scientists and inventors working on similar devices around the same time. Edison's bulb used a carbon filament which was able to withstand the high temperatures and glow for long periods of time. This was a major breakthrough as previous designs had used filaments made of platinum or other expensive materials, which were not practical for widespread use. Edison's invention revolutionized the way people lived and worked, making light readily available at all times of day and night. The electric bulb also paved the way for many other important technological advancements, including the development of power stations and electrical grids.\",\n",

Edison conducted hundreds of experiments over several years to find a filament that would not burn out quickly. Finally, in 1879, he succeeded in creating a carbon filament that could last over 40 hours without burning out in a vacuum bulb. This creation led to the widespread use of electric bulbs, and the world was transformed by this brilliant invention. The incandescent electric bulb became an essential component of daily life, and its innovation and development over the next century would bring about many changes in society.\",\n",

The carburetor works by creating a low-pressure area that pulls incoming air through an atomized fuel source. The amount of fuel delivered to the engine is controlled by the carburetor's throttle valve. The fuel-air mixture then goes into the engine cylinders for combustion.\\n\\nOn the other hand, MPFI engines use multiple fuel injectors that are positioned near each cylinder's intake valve. The fuel is injected directly into the cylinder in a precise amount and at precisely the right time, which leads to more efficient combustion. MPFI engines can monitor and adjust fuel delivery to each cylinder based on various driving conditions, which can result in better fuel efficiency and power output.\\n\\nIn summary, carburetor engines mix fuel and air in a central location, while MPFI engines inject the fuel directly into the cylinder. MPFI engines are more efficient and offer better performance, while carburetor engines are simpler and cheaper to manufacture. However, carburetor engines are obsolete in modern times, and almost all modern engines use the MPFI technology.\",\n",
